# Inventory 112
Tap 112 is a game made by Jonathan Li, Alexander Gotsis, Alex Hong, and Minnie Wu (aka Team CarpeStackOverflow) for the Hack 112 Hackathon 2016 at Carnegie Mellon University. The game takes any sound file (so long as it is a wav file wink emoticon ) and does a fast Fourier Transform on each small section of the song to determine the frequency makeup, and generate corresponding notes. Notes are hit as they reach the bottom of the screen.
